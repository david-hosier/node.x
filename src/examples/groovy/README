Node.x Groovy Examples
=======================

Prerequisites:

1) The bin directory from the distro must be on your PATH - this should have been done as part of the install procedure.

2) Groovy must be installed and the bin directory on your PATH as per the Groovy installation instructions

3) JDK/JRE 1.7.0+ must be installed and the JDK/JRE bin directory must be on your PATH

Run an example by invoking:

nodex-groovy <example groovy script>

where <example groovy script> is, for example, echo/echoServer.groovy

There now follows a description of all the available examples:

Echo Server + Client
====================

A simple echo server which echos back any sent to it

To run the server:

nodex-groovy echo/echoServer.groovy

Then telnet localhost 8080 and notice how text entered via telnet is echoed back

Instead of telnet you can also run a simple echo client:

nodex-groovy echo/echoClient.groovy

Fanout Server
=============

Fans out all data received on any one connection to all other connections.

To run the server:

nodex-groovy fanout/fanoutServer.groovy

Then telnet localhost 8080 from different consoles. Note how data entered in telnet is echoed to all connected connections


SSL
===

This is like the echo example, but this time using SSL. Please note that the keystore 
location in the script assumes the commands are executed from this directory exactly as shown below.

To run the server:

nodex-groovy ssl/sslServer.groovy

To run the client:

nodex-groovy ssl/sslClient.groovy
