  # DeferredAction is useful when you want to create your own Deferred actions.

  # Normally, instances of Deferred are returned from node.x modules to represent operations such as getting a key from
  # a Redis server, or copying a file. However if you wish to create your own instances you can do this by creating an
  # instance of this class specifying a block/Proc when creating it.
  #
  # The block/Proc will get called when the action is executed. Be sure to call {#result=} or {#exception=} when
  # the action is complete.

  # Composer allows asynchronous control flows to be defined.
  #
  # This is useful when you have some asynchronous actions to be performed after other actions have completed.
  # In a asynchronous framework such as node.x you cannot just block on the result of one action before executing
  # the next one, since an event loop thread must never block. By using Composer you can describe the execution order
  # of a sequence of actions in a quasi-direct way, even though when they execute it will all be asynchronous.
  #
  # Each action to execute is represented by an instance of {Deferred}. A Deferred represents an action
  # which is yet to be executed. Instances of Deferred can represent any asynchronous action, e.g. copying a file from A to B,
  # or getting a key from a Redis server.
  #
  # An example of using this class is as follows:
  #
  # @example
  #   # d1..dn are instances of Deferred, returned from other node.x modules, e.g. {@link org.nodex.java.core.file.FileSystem}
  #
  #   comp = new Composer.new
  #   comp.parallel(d1)
  #   comp.parallel(d2)
  #   comp.parallel(d3)
  #   comp.series(d4)
  #   comp.parallel(d5)
  #   comp.series(d6)
  #   comp.series(d7)
  #   comp.parallel(d8)
  #   comp.parallel(d9)
  #   comp.execute
  #
  # In the above example, when {#execute} is invoked, d1, d2, and d3 will be executed. When d1, d2, and d3
  # have all completed, then d4 and d5 will be executed. When d4 and d5 have completed d6 will be executed.
  # When d6 has completed d7, d8 and d9 will be executed. All this will occur asynchronous with no thread blocking for
  # anything to complete.
  #
  # Here is another example which uses the return values from actions in subsequent actions:
  #
  # @example
  #   comp = Composer.new
  #   future = comp.series(d1)
  #   comp.series{ puts "Result of d1 is #{future.result}" }
  #   comp.execute
  #
  # In the above example, when {#execute} is invoked d1 will be executed. When d1 completes the result of the action
  # will be available in the {Future} future, and the second action will be executed which simply displays the result.
