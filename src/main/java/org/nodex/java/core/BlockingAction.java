/**
 * <p>Sometimes it is necessary to perform operations in node.x which are inherently blocking, e.g. talking to legacy
 * blocking APIs or libraries. This class allows blocking operations to be executed cleanly in an asychronous
 * environment.</p>
 * <p>By subclassing this class, implementing the {@link SynchronousAction#action} method and executing it, node.x will perform the blocking operation on a thread from a
 * background thread pool specially reserved for blocking operations. This means the event loop threads are not
 * blocked and can continue to service other requests.</p>
 * <p>It will rarely be necessary to use this class directly, it is normally used by libraries which wrap legacy
 * blocking APIs into an asynchronous form suitable for a 100% asynchronous framework such as node.x</p>
